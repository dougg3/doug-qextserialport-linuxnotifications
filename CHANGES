1.0.0d

- Removed isOpen() overriden declaration/implementation from qextserialport's classes. isOpen() relies on QIODevice now.
- Removed bool portOpen variable. Replaced by internal QIODevice.openMode.
- Removed getChar(), putChar() overriden declaration/implementation. QIODevice can handle this.
* Calling open() with specified OpenMode invokes QIODevice::open() which result in proper openMode setting.
* readData(), writeData() are protected as in QIODevice declaration.
* QIODevice:: read() and write() function are working now (use them instead of readData() writeData()).
* readData(), writeData() don't check if port is open any more (read() and write() assures that). The same behaviour can be found in QFile for example.
* Fixed readLine().
