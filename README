= About QextSerialPort =

QextSerialPort provides an interface to old fashioned serial ports for Qt-based applications. It currently supports Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD. 

Please note that:

 * Revision {{{0.9.x}}} is Qt 2 & 3 compatible. 
 * Revision {{{1.x.x}}} is Qt 4 compatible.

And I hope that:

 * Revision {{{2.x.x}}} will be Qt 5 compatible 

But I am not the owner of the project, so I have no right to release new version.

This is Debao's clone, and I hope that it will be usefull for you.

== Refactor ==

I have made some code refactoring for QextSerialPort

 # D-pointer and Q_PRIVATE_SLOT are used to moving private members from QextSerialPort to QextSerialPortPrivate
 # qdoc3 instead of doxygen is used for generating documents
 # MIT license header add to all sources files
 # add a helper class QextWinEventNotifier for windows user, when user's SDK doesnot contain Qt's private files, this class will be auto selected.
 # Support platform custom baudrate. Macros such as B230400 / B460800 can be used directly if you OS support it.
 # many bugs have been fixed.
 # source compatible with old versions.

== How to use (1) ==

 * Download the source code. Note: [http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/ Mercurial] is needed .

            hg clone https://code.google.com/r/dbzhang800-qextserialport/


 * Put the source code in any directory you like. For example, 3rdparty:

            |-- project.pro
            |-- ....
            |-- 3rdparty\
            |     |-- qextserialport\
            |     |

 * Add following line to your qmake project file:

            include(3rdparty/qextserialport/src/qextserialport.pri)

 * Using QextSerialPort in your code. Enjoy it!

            #include "qextserialport.h"
            ....
            QextSerialPort * port = new QextSerialPort();
            ....
            
== How to use (2) ==

It's very easy to compile QextSerialPort directly into your application(see above section), however, we would prefer to use it as a static or shared library.

 * Download the source code, and put it in any location you like.

           |-- yourpath\
           |     |-- qextserialport\
           |     |

 * Create a config.pri file, and put into qextserialport's directory.

           |-- yourpath\
           |     |-- qextserialport\
           |     |     |-- config.pri
           
  * Contents of config_example.pri
  
           # uncomment the following line if you want to use qextserialport as library
           # QEXTSERIALPORT_LIBRARY = yes

           # uncomment the following line too if you want to use it as static library
           # QEXTSERIALPORT_STATIC = yes

 * Goto qextserialport/buildlib, and run following command to generate library.

           qmake
           make (or nmake)

 * Add following line to your qmake project file. Enjoy it!

           include(pathToQextserialport/src/qextserialport.pri)

== Build (optional) ==

 * Run qmake from the toplevel directory.(If your has create a config.pri file properly, this will generate the library, and then all examples will use the library. Otherwise, qextserialport will be directly compiled into the examples)

           qmake (or qmake -r)
           make (or nmake)

 * Run qdoc3 from the doc directory.

           qdoc3 qextserialport.qdocconf
