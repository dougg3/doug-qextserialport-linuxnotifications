1) introduction

    QextSerialPort provides an interface to old fashioned serial ports for
    Qt-based applications. It currently supports Mac OS X, Windows, Linux,
    FreeBSD.

    This is Debao's clone. Improvements have been made for the windows 
    environment. This Clone can theoretically run on other platforms, 
    but not guaranteed.

    Tested on:
        * Qt 4.7 / Windows XP / MSVC 2008
        * Qt 4.7 / Windows XP / MinGW
    
2) build

    * qmake
    * make (or nmake)

    note:
        If this is an config.pri which contains "QEXTSERIALPORT_LIBRARY = yes" 
    exists in the project's root dirction, shared library will be generated 
    before examples are compiled. If config.pri does not exist or does not 
    contains the line, no shared library will be generated.

3) build documents
    Run qdoc3 from the doc directory.
 
    * qdoc3 qextserialport.qdocconf
 
4) use
	Add the following line to your qmake project file:
    
    include(pathToPri/qextserialport.pri)
