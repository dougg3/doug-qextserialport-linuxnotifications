1) introduction

    QextSerialPort provides an interface to old fashioned serial ports for
    Qt-based applications. It currently supports Mac OS X, Windows, Linux,
    FreeBSD.

    This is Debao's clone. Improvements have been made for the windows 
    environment. This Clone can theoretically run on other platforms, 
    but not guaranteed.

    You can use QexSerailPort in three ways(see config.pri file):
        * shared library
        * static library
        * just include the source files
    
    Tested on:
        * Qt 4.7 / Windows XP / MSVC 2008
        * Qt 4.7 / Windows XP / MinGW
        * QT 4.7 / Linux / GCC
    
2) build(examples and library if any)
    * qmake
    * make (or nmake)

3) build documents
    Run qdoc3 from the doc directory.
    * qdoc3 qextserialport.qdocconf
 
4) use
    No matter which way you selected, all you need is: Add following line to
    your qmake project file:
       include(pathToPri/qextserialport.pri)

5) for msvc user
    If you use vcproj instead of nmake, you can try following line:
        qmake -tp vc -r
    But this works not well if you use qextserialport as shared or static library.
